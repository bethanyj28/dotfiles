# ~/.dotfiles

A new evolution of my dotfiles utilizing chezmoi for management. For now primarily focuses on codespaces environments, but may expand to mac and windows environments in the future.

## Features

### Ghostty Terminal Support

This repository includes terminfo support for the [Ghostty terminal emulator](https://ghostty.org/):

- **Codespaces**: Automatically installs `xterm-ghostty` terminfo when setting up Codespaces, ensuring proper terminal emulation when connecting from Ghostty
- **SSH Helper**: Provides `ssh-ghostty` function that automatically transfers Ghostty's terminfo to remote servers

#### Usage

To SSH with automatic terminfo transfer:

```bash
ssh-ghostty user@hostname [ssh options]
```

This will:
1. Transfer Ghostty's terminfo to the remote server
2. Connect via SSH

If Ghostty terminfo is not found locally, it falls back to regular SSH.
